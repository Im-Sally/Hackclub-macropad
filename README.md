# Hackclub-macropad

A small programmable macropad for 3D modelling with 9 buttons, 2 status LEDs and an OLED screen. The OLED is mounted in the lid, so replacing it later is easy I'll just need to desolder four wires and print a new lid. The display connects to the PCB using four wires soldered to the pads located in the top right corner of the board.
